**Revised Summary**:

The table and chart present data regarding visitor numbers and satisfaction levels at Ashdown Museum before and after its refurbishment. These figures indicate that the refurbishment had a positive impact on both visitor attendance and their satisfaction.

Prior to refurbishment, the museum attracted 74,000 visitors. Survey data from this period shows that dissatisfaction was prevalent, with 40% of visitors expressing discontent, the highest among recorded responses. Only 30% of visitors reported feeling satisfied, while the percentages for those who were very satisfied, very dissatisfied, and neutral were 15%, 10%, and 5%, respectively.

Post-refurbishment, there was a notable increase in visitor numbers to 92,000. Correspondingly, the percentage of visitors reporting satisfaction (satisfied and very satisfied) rose to 40% and 35%, respectively. Simultaneously, the rates of dissatisfaction (dissatisfied and very dissatisfied) declined to 15% and 5%. Notably, the proportion of neutral visitors remained unchanged.

In summary, the refurbishment of the museum appears to have successfully shifted the balance, with a higher percentage of visitors reporting satisfaction than dissatisfaction afterwards.
